\sysname is a documentation and typesetting system.  It is \emph{not}
a system for extracting documentation strings from Common Lisp source
code and turn it into HTML or some other format.  Instead, it is an
attempt to design a system that can replace TeX/LaTeX, DocBook,
Texinfo, and similar systems.
