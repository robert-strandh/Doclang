\sysname{} is a system for structuring documents, and in particular
software documentation.  Here is what \sysname{} is \emph{not}:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is not a system for \emph{extracting documentation strings}
  from Common Lisp source code and turn it into HTML or some other
  format.
\item It is also not another system defined in terms of the
  \emph{input syntax} that it accepts, as is the case for existing
  markup systems.
\item Finally, it is not an interactive system defined in terms of the
  \emph{gestures} that the user is allowed to emit.
\end{itemize}

Instead, it is a system that is defined in terms of a set of \clos{}
\emph{protocols}%
\footnote{A \clos{} protocol consists of a set of \emph{protocol
    classes} and a set of \emph{generic functions} operating on
  instances of those classes.}
defined on a data structure kept in main memory.
