\chapter{Purpose}
\label{chap-purpose}

The purpose of \sysname{} is to become a new documentation and
typesetting system.

Existing systems have several properties that we consider
undesirable:

\begin{itemize}
\item The surface syntax is arcane.  This is the case for instance
  with TeX/LaTeX that has strange rules for parsing the source text,
  resulting in surprising output, and for Texinfo that is inspired by
  Scribe.
\item The output format of some systems is a complete document that
  can not easily be split into smaller units for online documentation
  reading.  This is the case for TeX/LaTeX.
\item Some systems do not allow the user to create \emph{macros}.
  This is the case for DocBook.\footnote{Check that this statement is
    true.} 
\item Many systems lack the possibility of expressing important
  documentation elements such as bibliography entries and bibliography
  references.
\item etc.
\end{itemize}
