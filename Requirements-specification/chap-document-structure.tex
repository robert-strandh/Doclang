\chapter{Document structure}
\label{chap-document-structure}

In order to encourage reuse and factoring of text elements, we think
it might be a good idea to avoid fixed structuring elements such as
parts, chapters, sections, etc.  Instead, we think that text should be
structured into \emph{chunks}.%
\footnote{The name \emph{chunk} is preliminary, of course.}
A chunk might be a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a math
formula, a table, etc.  Furthermore, a single structuring chunk
(called, say, \emph{sequence}) would contain a list of inferior
chunks.  There would be some restrictions on what type of chunk can be
contained in what other chunk, of course.  

We think that any chunk could be \emph{labeled}.  A label could for
instance be a \cl{} symbol so that we can take advantage of the
package system for labeling chunks.
